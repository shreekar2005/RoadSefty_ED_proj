# RoadSefty_ED_proj
WE had ED (engineering design) course
for that we have made this project
(before running the code on your machine, make folder named "dnn_model" in your working dictionary and add model files named in "object_detection.py" during initializing class Object detection

Aim : To detect cars at blind spots and alert others (other side of blind spot) that some vehical is comming from other side. This will decrese rate of accidents at blind spots (mainly in sharp terns, Ghats, underbridge crossing etc)

demo for how our hardware works :

demo for testing model in real world :
